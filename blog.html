    <h1>Difference between map(),forEach(),filter() and find()</h1>
    <p>
      The main difference between map() and forEach() is the returning value.
      map() returns value and forEach () doesn't return value. Their functions
      are same but returning value remains different. On the other hand,the
      function of filter() and find() are almost same but the main difference is
      filter() returns an array containing the element that satisfies the
      condition, but find() returns the element itself that satisfies the
      condition.

    <h1>Difference between cookie ,session storage and local storage</h1>
    <p>
      Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access
      later, such as offline data. Session storage is similar to cookies, but
      the data is only stored for the current session. This means that the data
      will be deleted when the user closes the browser.

  <h1>What is event loop and how doest it works?</h1>
  <p>
    The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the
    Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the
    first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
    effectively runs it.

  <h1>The explanation of quizTimer</h1>
  <p>
    quizTimer() is a function which would taka dismiss as it's parameter. It
    would check the parameter with if condition if the condition become true it
    would simply execute clearInterval() and return. Else it would execute
    setInterval() where the given time of the function is 1000. SetInterval
    would do some simple math to find the exact time of the function and would
    set the innerText of the CountHtml element.

  <h1>The explanation of chooseQuiz?</h1>
  <p>
    chooseQuiz() is a function what would take index and givenAns as parameter.
    it would create a variable isExist where find() would go through an array
    answers to find the element where ans.id equal to quizData[index].id. If
    isExist is true it would execute the a loop through answer to find each
    quiz.If isExist.id qual to quiz.id it would stop the function and splice the
    answers array. Else quizData[index] and givenAnswer would push to the
    answers array. Finally, it would call the function displayAnswers(answers)
    to display answer in Ui.
